<!-- LOADER CONFIGURATION: When the project file specified on the command line
                           is loaded this is passed to a serie of processor
                           wich will translate it into the format specified
                           by "project.dtd". This file is only an example since
                           the loader configuration is by default located at
                           "sbk:/style/loader.xml" and packaged with the style
                           you want to use.
                           See "loader.dtd" for informations. -->
