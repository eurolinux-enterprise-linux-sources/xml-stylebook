<!-- PROJECT DTD: Defines the format of the project file, and in wich format
                  the loader, after processing the file supplied on the command
                  line, should instantiate the project. This DTD is not used,
                  actually, since most of the times the final project is the
                  result of one or more processing stages, but is given to you
                  as a reference on how StyleBook expects the project.
